                <p>Ballet is arguably one of the most graceful and beautiful styles of dance. It is well known by many people across the world. The art of ballet started out as a kind of dance for the wealthiest families in history. This art was born at a time when Roman and Geek Renaissance of the 15th and 16th centuries started which revived interest in the arts and in human too. The term “ballet” comes from the Italian word “Balla” which simply means dance. Ballet is a deeply traditional form where fixed steps are in a canonical way linked to each other which can be combined to make an unbounded variety of dances (Guidetti 78). Just like football which is quite a demanding physical game, ballet is also a physically demanding activity though unlike football, the body is used as a form of expression.Ostensibly, ballet is meant to be elegant and graceful not physically demanding like football. The art and the grace of a ballet performance controvert all the physical strain that is associated with it. In ballet, there is a principle that is used of overload that consists of three variables in training; frequency, duration and intensity. In order to experience increases in the improvement of skill, performance and technique, these variables must be manipulated or increased.</p>

                    <p>Break Dance</p>
                </div>
                <p>Breaking was born when street corner DJ's (in legend it is DJ Kool Herc who was first) would take the breakdown sections (or "breaks") of dance records and string them together or loop them without any elements of the song per se. This provided a raw rhythmic base for improvising and further mixing, and it allowed dancers to display their skills during the break. Breakdancing has a variety of influences, there is no tradition in breakdancing, dancers picked elements from other dances and sports including but not limited to gymnastics, Capoeira, lindy hop, disco, etc…Breakdance also known as breaking, b-girling or b-boying, is a street dance style that evolved as part of the hip hop movement that originated among African American and Latin American youths in the South Bronx of New York City during the early 1970s. It is arguably the best known of all hip hop dance styles. A breakdancer is also known as a breaker, and B-boy.</p>

                    <p>Tap Dance</p>
                </div>
                <p>Tap dance originated in the United States in the early 19th century at the crossroads of African and Irish American dance forms. When slave owners took away traditional African percussion instruments, slaves turned to percussive dancing to express themselves and retain their cultural identities. These styles of dance connected with clog dancing from the British Isles, creating a unique form of movement and rhythm.
                Early tap shoes had wooden soles, sometimes with pennies attached to the heel and toe. Tap gained popularity after the Civil War as a part of traveling minstrel shows, where white and black performers wore blackface and belittled black people by portraying them as lazy, dumb, and comical.</p>
